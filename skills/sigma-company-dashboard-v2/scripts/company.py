"""Company configuration — the ONLY file that changes between prospects.

Everything else in this generator (layout, personas, cards, alert rail, modeler,
modal, agent wiring) is company-agnostic. Swapping prospects means writing one
dict here, not editing the build.

The economics are deliberately per-product constants rather than a single
"revenue" number, because the whole demo rests on the P&L being internally
consistent: balances x yield - balances x funding + fees - provision - opex has
to reconcile to the headline KPI, or the first analyst in the room catches it.

# Healthcare payer. This is the config that proves the template is not secretly
# a banking template, so the mapping is worth spelling out:
#
#   products      -> benefit plans (Commercial, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid...)
#   bal_base      -> member months, the volume the P&L scales with
#   yield_rate    -> premium PMPM yield
#   funding_rate  -> medical cost PMPM (the payer's cost of goods)
#   fee_base      -> admin/ASO fee revenue
#   provision     -> IBNR reserve build
#   delinq        -> prior-auth denial-overturn rate, the quality signal
#   opex_ratio    -> admin expense ratio
#
# The spread between yield and funding IS the medical loss ratio, which is why
# the same cross-join scenario modeler works unchanged: a "rate shock" becomes a
# trend shock to medical cost.

# COLD-RUN TEST: derived from the company name alone, no hand-holding.
# McDonald's stresses the template because franchise economics are not lending
# economics: the "volume" is system-wide sales it does not book as revenue, and
# the "yield" is the royalty + rent rate it takes off the top.
#
#   volume  -> system-wide sales ($MM)
#   yield   -> royalty + rent rate taken by the franchisor
#   cost    -> company-operated restaurant operating cost
#   fee     -> initial franchise fees
#   risk    -> restaurants below plan (the operational quality signal)

# Activision Blizzard — interactive entertainment, FY2022 full-year.
# Three reporting segments from the 10-K: Activision (Call of Duty-led premium

# (Candy Crush mobile IAP). Acquired by Microsoft in Oct 2023; this build
# uses the last full standalone fiscal year.
#
# Mapping into the template:
#   product       -> reporting segment
#   volume        -> net revenues ($MM) — the P&L line the segment is judged on
#   yield         -> effective net revenue rate on gross bookings (~0.86-0.91)
#                    i.e. after platform/channel fees and deferred-revenue haircut
#   funding_rate  -> cost rate: platform fees + royalties + server COGS as % of
#                    net revenues. Gaming COGS are platform pass-through (30% for
#                    console/mobile storefronts) PLUS hosting/bandwidth; the rate
#                    is calculated against segment NET revenues.
#   fee_base      -> ancillary/licensing revenue beyond game sales, MONTHLY $MM.
#                    Advertising, hardware accessories, content licensing.
#   provision     -> refund and chargeback provision rate
#   delinq_rate   -> content underperformance / games-below-plan rate
#   opex_ratio    -> R&D + SG&A overhead as fraction of segment net revenues.
#                    Gaming is R&D-heavy (esp. Blizzard); 0.40-0.65 range.
#   units_base    -> MAUs in thousands. Activision ~100M, Blizzard ~35M, King ~238M.
#   shock         -> in-game net revenue trend shock
#
# FY2022 10-K calibration:
#   Activision: net revenues $2,313M, net bookings $2,282M, MAUs ~100M

        # trap documented in HANDOFF section 8 for Delta ("the column called

        # pass here set funding_rate to a separate cost-of-revenue rate
        # (yield=margin, funding=1-margin), which made the spread compute as

        # exceeded margin (0.30). Fixed by setting funding_rate=0 (same

        # yield_rate alone IS the spread, and it equals the segment's real

        # bal_base*yield_rate + fee_base*12 reconciles to each segment's real
        # FY2025 revenue.
        #
        # units_base is scaled at the generator's own headline-KPI scale, not

        # (empirical constant, see HANDOFF section 20). Gaming ships the most
        # discrete boards by far, so it carries the max and is calibrated to
        # land the "GPUs shipped (M)" headline around ~45-50M; the other
        # lines are scaled down from it in proportion to their real relative
        # unit volumes (Data Center ships far fewer, much more expensive
        # boards; Automotive/ProViz/OEM fewer still).
        # bal_base is back-solved (not the naive segment-revenue/margin figure)
        # to account for the loan_book.sql mechanics: the KPI card sums
        # SumIf(Net Revenue, "Current Period") across months 12-23 AND across
        # every FOOTPRINTS state, where each month's balance is
        # bal_base*state_share*(1+growth/12)^month_index*seasonal. Growth
        # compounding alone inflates the 12-23 month window ~1.01x-1.36x

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Alnylam Pharmaceuticals -- RNAi/siRNA therapeutics, FY2025 full-year. The
# first biotech/pharma build for this generator, so the mapping is worth
# spelling out (this is NOT a lending template with new labels):
#
#   products      -> real franchise / product lines from the 10-K:
#                    TTR Franchise (AMVUTTRA, ONPATTRO), Rare Disease
#                    Franchise (GIVLAARI, OXLUMO), plus a 5th administrative
#                    line for collaboration & royalty revenue (Roche,
#                    Regeneron, Novartis LEQVIO royalty) -- fee-only, no
#                    product volume of its own, same shape as Elevance's
#                    "ASO Self-funded" line.
#   bal_base      -> patients-on-therapy-weighted net product revenue base,
#                    $MM (back-solved, see note below -- NOT literally
#                    revenue/margin)
#   yield_rate    -> gross margin on net product revenue. RNAi biologics run
#                    materially higher gross margin than a bank's asset
#                    yield or an airline's RASM -- 80-86% here, matching
#                    Alnylam's real COGS profile (COGS ~14-20% of net
#                    product revenue).
#   funding_rate  -> set to 0 for every product. This is the exact trap
#                    documented in HANDOFF section 8 (Delta's RASM/CASM,
#                    then NVIDIA's gross-margin business): the generator's
#                    "Net Revenue" column is a SPREAD
#                    (income - cost + fees), not a revenue line. A biotech's
#                    real economics ARE that spread -- funding_rate=0 lets
#                    yield_rate alone equal the true gross margin, the same
#                    pattern already used for SoFi Money and every NVIDIA
#                    segment.
#   fee_base      -> MONTHLY $MM (x12 in the SQL -- the Nuvia trap). Used for
#                    Collaborations & Royalties, which has no bal_base/yield
#                    of its own; its entire revenue is fee_base x 12.
#   provision_rate -> set near 0; there is no credit/refund provision
#                    analogous to a bank's -- rare-disease payer contracts
#                    carry negligible bad debt relative to list price.
#   delinq_rate   -> repurposed as a "patient discontinuation / non-adherence
#                    rate" -- the risk metric that actually matters for a
#                    chronic-therapy rare-disease franchise.
#   opex_ratio    -> R&D + SG&A load against gross profit (Alnylam's R&D and
#                    SG&A together run close to net product revenue as the
#                    company approaches durable profitability).
#   units_base    -> patients on therapy, at the generator's own KPI scale
#                    (see note below) -- NOT US population, NOT a mass-market
#                    unit count. This is an ultra-rare-disease population.
#
# bal_base back-solve: the KPI compounds bal_base through
# (1+annual_growth/12)**month_index over months 12-23, summed across every
# FOOTPRINTS state share (share_sum ~0.924 here), which inflates or deflates
# the naive bal_base = revenue/margin figure. Solved numerically against a
# standalone reproduction of loan_book.sql's math (script discarded after
# use); the four product bal_base values below render within +0.55%/-3.21%
# of the real FY2025 net product revenue figures, and total revenue across
# all five lines (incl. Collaborations & Royalties) renders within -0.55% of
# the real $3,713.9M FY2025 total revenue.
#
# AMVUTTRA's real FY2025 YoY growth was +138%, off an unusual pent-up-demand
# base the year of its ATTR-CM approval -- not a sustainable forward run
# rate. annual_growth=.85 here instead approximates the growth implied by
# FY2026 guidance (TTR franchise net product revenue of $4,400-4,700M against
# a 2025 AMVUTTRA+ONPATTRO base of ~$2,486.6M is roughly +77-89% blended,
# and ONPATTRO is declining, so AMVUTTRA alone must grow faster than the
# blended franchise number).

#   yield_rate    -> premium PMPM yield (rate)

#
# HONEST LABELING (the Delta/NVIDIA/Enumclaw trap, again): the shared engine's
# "Net Revenue" is income-cost+fees, a SPREAD -- not Alliant's own corporate
# revenue (a broker's real revenue is just commission+fee, full stop). Here
# that spread is genuinely useful as "the aggregate client book's net plan
# economics" -- exactly what a benefits broker's analytics platform reports
# to a client's CFO. Labelled "Net Plan Revenue ($M)", not "Alliant Revenue".

# Two things resolved here by reading member_population.sql rather than

#  1. The Near Prime/Prime/Super Prime/Exceptional literal drives seg_credit
#     (credit_band, with its own 1-4 credit_order) -- that's the coverage-
#     tier axis, and its ordinal 1-4 already matches EE(1)/ES(2)/EC(3)/
#     Family(4) exactly, so no reordering needed.
#  2. The Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Dormant literal drives seg_engage
#     (engagement, its own 1-4 order) -- NOT an age axis. The real age axis
#     is a separate hardcoded column (age_band: 18-27/28-37/38-47/48-57/58+)
#     that every prior company (sofi/enumclaw/pura/veraset) has only ever
#     RELABELLED via seg_age, never rewritten -- these ranges already read as
#     plausible employee age brackets, so Alliant follows that same
#     precedent rather than hand-rolling a new literal-rewrite path in
#     population_sql for a cosmetic bucket-width difference from the
